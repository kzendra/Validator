# Validator
Test project for validation of value of enum flags property

Basic idea behind this project is to create validation for value of a enum with flags attribute.
This should be approached by replacing exception thrown in validator code by actual validation. 
Prototypes of any method should not be changed and types defined in unit test should not be referenced outside unit test as that will defy the purpose of purely generic validator.

Current code is sum of copy pasted chunks of code from actual app and is not intended to look nice, well organized or be well written.

Any part of code here can be copied, used and reused as you see fit.
